            My Favorite Hobby
        </h3>
        <p>
            I love aviation. I have been on airplanes ever since I was an infant and never cried during 
            a flight. As a toddler I liked to play with toy airplanes. As I got older I started looking 
            forward to trips on airplanes and expressed my interest in being a pilot. I came to Lewis 
            University with the plan to become a pilot, but due to medical complications I could not 
            medically qualify to pilot any aircraft. However, I didn't let that stop me from pursuing 
            a career in the field of aviation. I am currently an aviation administration major.

            Fun Fact
        </h3>
        <p>
            I was the only person in the United States to receive a double lung and heart transplant in 
            2016.

        <p>I had a double lung and heart transplant on November 30, 2016. It was the only transplant of its kind in the US that year. When I was about 16 months old I had a rare form of muscular cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma. Luckily the combined efforts of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy were able to eradicate all of the cancer and it never came back. However, as I got older a side effect of the chemotherapy led to stiff scar tissue to accumulate in my lungs which could not properly absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. As this worsened, my heart became overstressed due to the lack of oxygen. After over a year of evaluations at numerous hospitals as far as Boston, I finally found a hospital that would accept me as a transplant candidate. St. Louis Children's Hospital was willing to attempt the transplant when other hospitals said that it was too risky and that I would not survive the operation. Once I moved to St. Louis, I was immediately admitted to the ICU due to my feeble condition. I remained there until I received my new organs. After my transplant, I had to relearn how to walk and write and my stomach was in a state of gastroparesis due to my vagal nerve being severed which permanently changed the way my body digests food. Miraculously, less than a month after the transplant I was able to leave the hospital and live in the St. Louis area to visit the hospital as an outpatient for tests and physical therapy. During my time in St. Louis, sevral news sources interviewed me including CNN (their article can be found <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/health/heart-lung-transplant-kid-spencer-kolman/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>) and KSDK News which is the main local news channel for St. Louis (their story about be is below). The following March I was cleared to return home.</p>
